# Discord-Bot-Template
A handler Discord bot template developped by me.

# Configuration

You have a file (config.json) where you can config your bot with your infos (if it's no make, you must create a bot in discord developper portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications/))

The base prefix set is *. Where are different commands (ping, stop and say). In config, the field "ID_MEMBERS_HAS_PERMISSION_STOP_BOT" serves at enter id (one at at time) of all members who can stop the bot, push a field if you don't need that. Expemple : 

"ID_MEMBERS_HAS_PERMISSION_STOP_BOT": ["64621651244515212", "564121545212"]
